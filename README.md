Hi there! I'm Marcel Ramos, an electrician turned aspiring software developer. 
I’ve recently discovered my passion for coding, and I'm diving headfirst into the world of full-stack development. 
My journey into tech is driven by a desire to explore new opportunities.

With a solid foundation in electrical work and industrial environment, I bring a unique perspective to problem-solving and a hands-on approach to learning. 
I’m also interested in cybersecurity and DevSecOps, as I believe that securing our digital environments is just as crucial as building them.

I’m excited to connect with fellow tech enthusiasts, share knowledge, and learn from this vibrant community. I’m eager to contribute and help others as I grow in my skills. 
Let’s collaborate and innovate together!

Feel free to reach out
I’m open to discussions, advice, and new opportunities!
